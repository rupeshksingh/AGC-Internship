# Model Refinement: Wavelet Transform & Enhanced XGBoost (Week 5)

This document outlines the work from the fifth week, which focused on exploring an advanced signal processing technique and on optimizing the XGBoost model with new features and hyperparameter tuning.

## üéØ Objective

The goal for this week was to refine the modeling approach by:
1.  **Exploring Wavelet Transform**: Investigating the use of the **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** to analyze the time series data at different frequency resolutions.
2.  **Enhancing the XGBoost Model**: Improving upon the previous XGBoost implementation by engineering more robust features and tuning the model's hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodologies & Enhancements

### **1. Wavelet Transform Exploration**
The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) was used as an exploratory data analysis technique to gain deeper insights into the time series data.

* **Methodology**:
    * The DWT was applied to the roller speed data to decompose the signal into multiple levels of **approximation** (low-frequency) and **detail** (high-frequency) coefficients.
    * This technique allows for the analysis of the signal at different scales, which can help in identifying transient phenomena and frequency-dependent patterns that are not easily visible in the time domain.
* **Findings**:
    * This exploration demonstrated that DWT is a powerful tool for feature extraction in time series analysis. The resulting coefficients can potentially be used as features for machine learning models, capturing information about both the trend and the volatility of the signal.

### **2. Enhanced XGBoost Model**
The previous XGBoost model was significantly improved through new feature engineering and systematic hyperparameter tuning.

* **Methodology**:
    * **New Features**: The model was enhanced with more sophisticated features designed to capture the complex dynamics of the roller speed data.
    * **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The model's hyperparameters were carefully tuned to optimize its performance, preventing overfitting and improving its ability to generalize to new data.
    * **Training & Evaluation**: The modified XGBoost model was trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated to measure the performance uplift from the new features and tuning.
* **Findings**:
    * The refined XGBoost model served as a highly optimized and powerful baseline. This enhancement process underscored the significant impact that thoughtful feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning can have on the performance of even a strong baseline model.
